# 🎓 College Feedback Classifier

This project uses **IBM watsonx.ai** to automatically classify student feedback into relevant categories such as **Academics**, **Facilities**, and **Administration**.  
> ⚠️ Note: This project **does not perform sentiment analysis** — the focus is purely on identifying the **category** or **topic area** of the feedback.

---

## 🧠 Project Objective

To streamline and automate the classification of student feedback so institutions can efficiently route concerns, suggestions, or praise to the appropriate departments.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

- **Input**: A CSV file containing open-ended student feedback with optional sentiment labels.
- **Model**: The few-shot classification capability of **IBM watsonx.ai** analyzes each feedback entry and predicts its relevant **category**.
- **Output**: The original CSV file is updated with a new column named **Predicted Category**.

## 🧪 Sample Output

| Feedback                                             | Sentiment | Category        | Predicted Category |
|------------------------------------------------------|-----------|------------------|---------------------|
| The professors explain concepts very clearly.        | positive  | Academics        | Academics           |
| The canteen food is not hygienic.                    | negative  | Facilities        | Facilities          |
| The admin staff is friendly and helpful.             | positive  | Administration    | Administration      |
| The online learning platform is easy to use.         | positive  | Academics         | Academics           |

> ✅ *Sentiment is not predicted — it is assumed to be pre-existing in the dataset for context.*
